T-test for summer vs winter : 

We hypothesized that crime might be higher during the summer, because students are not in school and in general, people spend more time outside.
 
We claimed a null hypothesis that crime rate is same throughout the months in a year.  We performed a two-tailed t-test for crime rate in each month as we have less than 30 samples as in a year we have 12 months so we picked t-test.
 
We performed t-test for five cities, which we are using for our
project. In this we counted month from June to September as a summer
and month from October to May as a winter season.

T-test for daylight saving :

We hypothesized that crime might be higher during the daylight saving, because more people are on streets. We claimed a null hypothesis that crime rate is same throughout the months in a year.  We performed a two-tailed t-test for crime rate in each month. 

 
We performed t-test for five cities, which we are using for our
project. In this we counted month from March to November as a daylight
saving month and month from December to February as non- daylight
saving months.

You can just run the code using python tstats.py
