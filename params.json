For our midterm report, we statistically tested that hypothesis (in place of applying machine learning) by comparing the number of crimes in our dataset that occurred before and after dark.\r\n\r\nTo do so, we used precise sunrise and sunset times for the cities and years for which we have crime data from the United States Naval Observatoryâ€™s Naval Oceanography Portal (http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneYear.php), adjusted for Daylight Savings Time (http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/daylight_time.php). First, we counted the number of crimes that occurred in the darkness (between sunset and midnight or between midnight and sunrise) vs. the daylight (between sunrise and sunset). We tracked separate counts for (a) crimes collapsed across all cities and all types of crimes, (b) crimes broken down by city and collapsed across all types of crime, and (c) crimes broken down by type of crime and collapsed across all cities. Then, we performed binomial tests of the null hypothesis that a crime is equally likely to occur in the darkness or in the daylight.\r\n\r\nWe found that the crimes are NOT equally likely to occur in the darkness or the daylight but are much more likely to occur during hours of darkness. Please see below for a summary of our statistical results. These results held for every city as well as for every type of crime, with the exception of hate crimes. However, we only have hate crime data from one city (Boston) and only have 35 incidents of hate crimes total (13 in the daylight and 22 in the darkness). \r\n\r\nIt's interesting to note that we all saw a heat map of Chicago crime in VizOne that gave the impression that crime in Chicago is more likely during the day. To investigate, we compared the types of crime represented in the cleaned Chicago dataset from VizZOne with the types of crime represented in our dataset. Because our end goal is to build an app that helps pedestrians, we limited our project to crimes that happen on the street and that seem likely to affect the safety of a pedestrian. The VizOne Chicago data includes a much broader range of crimes, which we think explains the discrepancy between the VizOne heatmap and our statistical results for Chicago (and other cities).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Across all cities and types of crime**\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 104098 incidents | Darkness: 394221 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 2.47032822921e-323`\r\n\r\n**By city, across all types of crime**\r\n\r\n_NEW YORK_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 22222 incidents | Darkness: 51876 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 9.88131291682e-324`\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHICAGO_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 7784 incidents | Darkness: 16551 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 4.94065645841e-324`\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOSTON_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 24149 incidents | Darkness: 48075 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 9.88131291682e-324`\r\n\r\n\r\n_DENVER_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 22481 incidents | Darkness: 31938 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 9.88131291682e-324`\r\n\r\n\r\n_PHILLY_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 27462 incidents | Darkness: 245781 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 1.48219693752e-323`\r\n\r\n**By type of crime, across all cities**\r\n\r\n_HOMICIDE_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 340 incidents | Darkness: 1404 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 2.8697439064e-153`\r\n\r\n\r\n_CRIMINAL SEXUAL ASSAULT_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 421 incidents | Darkness: 3828 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 0.0`\r\n\r\n\r\n_ROBBERY_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 9189 incidents | Darkness: 38222 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 4.94065645841e-324`\r\n\r\n_ASSAULT_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 23879 incidents | Darkness: 119539 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 9.88131291682e-324`\r\n\r\n\r\n_BURGLARY_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 7672 incidents | Darkness: 35680 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 4.94065645841e-324`\r\n\r\n\r\n_THEFT_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 58986 incidents | Darkness: 184095 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 1.48219693752e-323`\r\n\r\n\r\n_BATTERY_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 1627 incidents | Darkness: 2554 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 6.88691451774e-47`\r\n\r\n\r\n_WEAPONS VIOLATION_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 1575 incidents | Darkness: 4992 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 4.94065645841e-324`\r\n\r\n\r\n_OFFENSE INVOLVING CHILDREN_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 69 incidents | Darkness: 454 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 1.72842011796e-70`\r\n\r\n\r\n_CRIMINAL SEXUAL OFFENSE_\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 327 incidents | Darkness: 3431 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 0.0`\r\n\r\n_HATE CRIME_\r\n\r\n\r\n`Daylight: 13 incidents | Darkness: 22 incidents`\r\n\r\n`P-Value: 0.175465248991`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
